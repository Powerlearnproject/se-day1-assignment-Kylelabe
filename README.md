Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry. Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering tools, principles and methods to develop and maintain high-quality software systems. Importance: It enables creation of software solutions that power various aspects of modern life like communication, commerce, entertainment and healthcare.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

The development of programming languages like C
The establishment of software engineering as a discipline that took place in the 1960s
The emergence of structured programming in the 1970s
List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

Requirements - the user needs and system requirements are gathered and get documented
Design - as per the outlined requirements, high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface are made
Implementation - the developer gets to write code and builds the software as per the design specifications
Testing - after implementation, various tests are to ensure the product meets the quality standards expected.
Deployment - the tested software gets released to the users
Maintenance - support, updates and enhancement services are offered oftenly after deployment
Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate. Waterfall methodology is one that imploys a sequential approach that has distinct phases e.g. in software development i.e. (requirements, design, implementation...) while agile methodologies uses iterative and incremental approach that mostly focuses on flexibility, collaboration and responding to change e.g. extreme programming.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

A software developer is responsible for writing code and implementing solutions in a software development cycle.
A quality assurance engineer implements design and execution test that ensure quality on a software.
A project manager is one that oversees the planning, execution and delivery of software projects.
Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each. IDE provides software tools for writing, debugging and testing code e.g. Visual Studio Code while a VCS is a tool for tracking changes to source code and collaborating work among team members e.g. Git

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

Changing requirements during the development cycle leading to delays; solution - effective communication
Tight deadlines leading to unplanned pressure to deliver software products on a schedule resulting to rushed development and compromised quality; solution - priotization of tasks
Technical debt caused by shortcuts or suboptimal solutions that could lead to increased maintenance costs; solution - use of agile methodologies
Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

Unit - test done on individual components or modules of software thus aiding to the final product doesn't get to experience a fault as a result of single component/module.
Integration - test interactions between different components/subsystems ; this aids to ensure synchrony in modules implemented together.
System - is test carried on the whole software system thus ensuring the product delivered is of quality expected.
Acceptance - is test carried against user requirements which ensures the product meets the user needs.
#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models. Is the creation of prompts/questions to get the best possible responses from AI models. Importance:

Makes one's question clearer and specific
Improves the quality of AI-generated content
It gives developers more control over how users interact with AI
Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective. Vague prompt: Who is the president of USA? Improved version: Who is the elected president of USA? In the first scenario, it could display the current president who is Biden or even the previous presidents of USA while in the second. it will give Donald Trump as the answer as he hasn't been sworn in yet.
